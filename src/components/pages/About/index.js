        <p>
          My name is Elizabeth and I graduated from the University of Richmond
          in May of 2021. Born and raised in Naples, Florida I am a diehard warm
          weather lover. I am also an avid runner and tennis player. In my spare
          time I also LOVE to bake, but my one rule is I will only bake
          something I will eat! I graduated with a BS in Biology on the pre-med
          track, however, recently I have found myself being pulled in a
          different direction. With a passion for learning and an interest in
          coding I decided to embark on a new journey and jump into the world of
          coding. Through this Fullstack Coding Bootcamp Course I have gained
          the skills necessary to succeed in this field. Here you will find some
          of the projects I've curated with all that I've learned!
